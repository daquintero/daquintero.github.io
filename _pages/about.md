My PhD is on co-designing electronics and optics on multiple silicon chips to create quantum systems.

My current interests are in open-source software for multi-physics systems to design systems currently cannot with disjointed models.

Drop me a message if you think there's somewhere where the software I design or my expertise can help you.
