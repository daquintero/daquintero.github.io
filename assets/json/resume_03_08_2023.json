I also design software tools to design and simulate such systems, and am a contributor to multiple open-source projects. I have tapeout >4 silicon mixed-signal electronics chips in XFAB and TSMC via Cadence, and photonics in AMF through IPKISS. However, I am now a passionate supporter of open-source tools. \n\nMy BEng was on Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, and for my thesis I built an uncertified Class-4 mechanical-electrical-optical-thermally controlled quantum spintronic experiment in my bedroom during COVID. I have also done multiple internships from large multinational companies to small startups.\n\nMy current interests are in creating software tools to design multi-physical systems and solve problems we currently cannot with disjointed physics models. \n\nI am exploring if there is a market for consulting about these multi-physical design challenges, so drop me a message if you think there's somewhere where the software I design or my expertise can help you.\n\nðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦","location":{"countryCode":"US","address":"United Kingdom"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"darioquintero","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darioquintero/"}]},"work":[{"name":"Qontrol Systems","position":"Electronics Design Engineer","startDate":"2020-11-30","endDate":"","highlights":[],"summary":"I have:\n- Developed next-generation electronics to control integrated photonic systems, and some core mixed-signal circuitry to implement this.
